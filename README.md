# Vanilla-JavaScript-Weather-App
When I learned Javascript, I started with React.js and its corresponding libraries like Redux, Axios, jQuery, etc.
Since then, I always wanted to go back and experience what vanilla javascript was like.

For this project, I will be making a weather app in pure javascript, css, and html. This project is purely for fun.
So feel free to clone and make additions/delitions to it.

# As of April 2019 - Weather App V1

As of now, The application can be ran from localhost because of a really helpful tool called Cors : https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/.
This allows you to proxy to the Dark Sky API: https://darksky.net/forecast/40.7127,-74.0059/us12/en from localhost. (This is not needed if you 
host from 3rd party hosting platform).

The app displays the location of the current user session (If location services are allowed). Also displays the current icon accordingly.
Celcius and Fahrenheit is supported by clicking the temperature. A discription of the temperature is also displayed.

## Future Updates

Future updates will include showing the whole week of weather and its corresponding icons.
A timer will also be added to the top of the page so you know the time, 12 and 24 hour format should be supported just like the temperature.

# As of June 2022 - I remembered to add the final result image ðŸ˜‚

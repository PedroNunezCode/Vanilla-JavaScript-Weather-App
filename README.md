# Vanilla-JavaScript-Weather-App
When I learned Javascript, I started with React.js and its corresponding libraries like Redux, Axios, jQuery, etc.
Since then, I always wanted to go back and experience what vanilla javascript was like.

For this project, I will be making a weather app in pure javascript, css, and html. This project is purely for fun.
So feel free to clone and make additions/delitions to it.
